# Openclawssy

Openclawssy is a security-first AI agent runtime in the Ussyverse: one Go binary, explicit controls, auditable runs, and operator-first defaults.

It is for builders who want agent power without mystery behavior.

## Ussyverse Context

Openclawssy is part of the open-source Ussyverse ecosystem: experimental, fast-moving, and built in public.

- Main hub: https://www.ussy.host
- Ussyverse Discord: https://discord.gg/6b2Ej3rS3q

## What It Does

- Runs agents through CLI, HTTP, dashboard, Discord, and scheduler channels.
- Enforces deny-by-default capability policy and workspace-safe file boundaries.
- Persists reproducible run artifacts and append-only audit logs.
- Supports encrypted secret ingestion with write-only dashboard/API handling.
- Provides multi-agent control with per-agent profiles, model overrides, and routing pointers.
- Includes session-aware chat timelines and operational controls for long-running workloads.

## Core Capabilities

- Runtime and channels
  - `openclawssy ask`, `openclawssy run`, `openclawssy serve`, `openclawssy cron`
  - HTTP APIs for runs and chat queueing
  - Dashboard admin surface for status/config/scheduler/secrets/docs
  - Discord bridge with allowlists and rate limiting

- Agent and policy control
  - Agent lifecycle tools (`agent.list`, `agent.create`, `agent.switch`)
  - Per-agent config profiles (`agents.profiles.<agent_id>`) with model override fields
  - Inter-agent tooling (`agent.message.send`, `agent.message.inbox`, `agent.run`)
  - Policy-gated admin operations (`policy.admin` for sensitive cross-agent edits)

- Safety and observability
  - Workspace/path guards, symlink-safe write checks, and control-plane file protection
  - Structured tool errors and bounded loop execution
  - Persisted bundles per run (`input`, `prompt`, `toolcalls`, `output`, `meta`)
  - Audit logs with redaction behavior

## Quickstart

Prerequisite: Go 1.24+

```bash
make fmt
make lint
make test
make build
```

```bash
./bin/openclawssy setup
./bin/openclawssy doctor -v
./bin/openclawssy serve --token change-me
```

Then open:

- `https://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard` (TLS enabled)
- `http://127.0.0.1:8080/dashboard` (TLS disabled)

## How To Use It

- Fast local run:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy ask -agent default -message "hello"
```

- Tool-driven run:

```bash
./bin/openclawssy run -agent default -message '/tool time.now {}'
```

- API run:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/runs \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer change-me' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"agent_id":"default","message":"summarize project status"}'
```

## Prototype Warning

This is still a prototype under active development.

- Expect breaking changes.
- Use isolated environments and test credentials only.
- Do not run production-critical workloads on it yet.
